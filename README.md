# Neural Style Transfer on Segmented Local Object

This is a demonstration of localized neural style transfer using Matterport's implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) 
and Tensorflow's implementation of [neural style transfer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/nst_blogpost/4_Neural_Style_Transfer_with_Eager_Execution.ipynb#scrollTo=7qMVNvEsK-_D).


## Prerequisites
- python3.6+

In order to run this repo, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the terminal to install all the required libraries.

## Interactive Walk-through

An interactive version of this package is available at [segmented_neural_style_transfer.ipynb](notebooks/segmented_neural_style_transfer.ipynb)

After installing all the libraries with pip, type `jupyter notebook` and navigate to `notebooks/segmented_neural_style_transfer.ipynb`.
